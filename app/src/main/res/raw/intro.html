fables in verse and prose, arranged within a frame story. The original Sanskrit 
work, which some scholars believe was composed around the 3rd century BCE, is 
attributed to Vishnu Sharma. It is based on older oral traditions, including 
"animal fables that are as old as we are able to imagine".<br />
<br />
There are recorded over two hundred different versions known to exist in more 
than fifty languages, and three-quarters of these languages are extra-Indian. As 
early as the eleventh century this work reached Europe, and before 1600 it 
existed in Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, German, English, Old Slavonic, Czech, 
and perhaps other Slavonic languages. Its range has extended from Java to 
Iceland. <br /><br />it has been worked over and over again, expanded, abstracted, turned
into verse, retold in prose, translated into medieval and modern vernaculars, 
and retranslated into Sanskrit.<br /><br /> And most of the stories contained in it have
"gone down" into the folklore of the story-loving Hindus, whence they reappear 
in the collections of oral tales gathered by modern students of folk-stories.<br />
<br />
Thus it goes by many names in many cultures. In India, it had at least 25 
recensions, including the Sanskrit Tantrākhyāyikā and inspired the Hitopadesha. 
It was translated into Middle Persian in 570 CE by Borzūya. <br /><br />This became the
basis for a Syriac translation as Kalilag and Damnag and a translation into 
Arabic in 750 CE by Persian scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa as Kalīlah wa 
Dimnah. <br /><br />A New Persian version by Rudaki in the 12th century became known as
Kalīleh o Demneh and this was the basis of Kashefi's 15th century Anvār-i 
Suhaylī or Anvār-e Soheylī. The book in different form is also known as The 
Fables of Bidpai or The Morall Philosophie of Don.<br />

The Panchatantra is a series of inter-woven fables, many of which involve 
animals exhibiting animal stereotypes.<br /><br /> According to its own narrative, it
illustrates, for the benefit of three ignorant princes, the central Hindu 
principles of nīti. <br /><br />While nīti is hard to translate, it roughly means prudent
worldly conduct, or "the wise conduct of life".<br />
<br />
Apart from a short introduction — in which the author, Vishnu Sharma, is 
introduced as narrating the rest of the work to the princes — it consists of 
five parts.<br /><br /> Each part contains a main story, called the frame story, which in
turn contains several stories "emboxed" in it, as one character narrates a story 
to another.<br /><br /> Often these stories contain further emboxed stories. The stories
thus operate like a succession of Russian dolls, one narrative opening within 
another, sometimes three or four deep. Besides the stories, the characters also 
quote various epigrammatic verses to make their point.<br />

The five books are called:</strong><br />
<br />
Mitra-bheda: The Separation of Friends.<br />
<br />
Mitra-lābha or Mitra-samprāpti: The Gaining of Friends (The Dove, Crow, Mouse, 
Tortoise and Deer)<br />
<br />

<br />
Labdhapraṇāśam: Loss of Gains (The Monkey and the Crocodile)<br />
<br />

<strong>Original Indian version:</strong><br />
<br />
In the first book, a friendship arises between the lion Piṅgalaka, the king of 
the forest, and Sañjīvaka, a bull.<br /><br /> Karataka ('Horribly Howling') and Damanaka
('Victor') are two jackals that are retainers to the lion king. Against 
Karataka's advice, Damanaka breaks up the friendship between the lion and the 
bull out of jealousy.<br /><br /> This book contains around thirty stories, mostly told by
the two jackals. It is the longest of the five books, making up roughly 45% of 
the work's length.<br />
<br />
Seeing the favour the rat performed to free the dove (or pigeon) and her 
companions, a crow decides to befriend the rat, despite the rat's initial 
objections. <br /><br />The storyline evolves as their friendship grows to include the
turtle and the fawn. They collaborate to save the fawn when he is trapped, and 
later they work together to save the turtle, who falls in the trap.<br /><br /> This makes
up about 22% of the total length.<br />

<br />
Traditional enemies, the crows and the owls are at war. One of the crows 
pretends to be an outcast from his own group to gain entry into the rival owl 
group; he learns their secrets and vulnerabilities. <br /><br />He later summons his group
of crows to set fire to all entrances to the cave where the owls live and the 
creatures suffocate to death. This is about 26% of the total length.<br />

The Persian Ibn al-Muqaffa' translated the Panchatantra (in Middle Persian: 
Kalilag-o Demnag) from Middle Persian to Arabic as Kalīla wa Dimna. <br /><br />This is
considered the first masterpiece of "Arabic literary prose." By the time the
Sanskrit version migrated several hundred years through Pahlavi (Middle Persian) 
into Arabic, some important differences arose.<br />
<br />
The introduction and the frame story of the first book changed. An initial 
introduction explains how the book was first composed at the time of Alexander 
the Great's attempt to reach India.<br /><br /> In it an Indian King repents past misdeeds
and requests an Indian sage (called Bidaba) to compose a body of work with 
wisdom and fables that are to be passed down for the future generations. This is 
then stored in the great vault of kings as a national treasure. In the second 
part a Persian emperor hears of a great book of wisdom in the vaults of 
treasures in the land of the Indian kings.<br /><br /> He sends one of his trusted aides who
spends years winning the trust of the inner circle in the castle before he is 
able to access the book and return with it to Persia.<br /><br /> The Persian emperor then
rewards him and allows him to translate the book into the Persian language to be 
read by everyone. Ibn Al-Muqaffa then follows this long introduction, 
interjected with many sayings of wisdom, fables and noteworthy morals, with the 
actual fables of Kalila and Dimna.<br />
<br />
The two jackals' names transmogrified into Kalila and Dimna. Perhaps because the 
first section constituted most of the work, or because translators could find no 
simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the 
Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra', the jackals' names, Kalila and Dimna, became the 
generic name for the entire work in classical times.<br />
<br />
After the first chapter, Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ inserted a new one, telling of Dimna's 
trial. The jackal is suspected of instigating the death of the bull “Shanzabeh", 
a key character in the first chapter. <br /><br />The trial lasts for two days without
conclusion, until a tiger and leopard appear to bear witness against Dimna. He 
is found guilty and put to death.<br />
<br />
Ibn al-Muqaffa' inserted other additions and interpretations into his 750CE 
"re-telling" (see Francois de Blois' Burzōy's voyage to India and the origin of 
the book Kalīlah wa Dimnah).<br /><br /> The political theorist Jennifer London suggests
that he was expressing risky political views in a metaphorical way. (Al-Muqaffa' 
was murdered within a few years of completing his manuscript).<br /><br /> London has
analysed how Ibn al-Muqaffa' could have used his version to make "frank 
political expression" at the 'Abbasid court (see J. London's “How To Do Things 
With Fables: Ibn al-Muqaffas Frank Speech in Stories from Kalila wa Dimna.<br />
<br />
Al-Muqaffa' also changed the characterisation of some animals, perhaps to have 
local types which his readers would recognise.<br /><br /> For instance, the crocodile in
the fourth chapter is changed to a tortoise[verification needed], and the 
mongoose into a weasel. The Brahman is described as a "hermit".<br />
<br />
He begins each chapter of Kalila wa Dimna with a guiding frame-story theme that 
suggests key aspects of leadership:<br />
<br />
One should always be wary if one friend accuses another of crime;<br />
<br />
(Added chapter) Truth will be revealed, sooner or later;<br />
<br />
Cooperation among friends is vital to their survival;<br />
<br />
Mental strength and deceit are stronger in warfare than brute force;<br />
<br />
One must be careful not to betray friends, especially guarding against one's own 
tendencies towards foolishness; and<br />
One should be wary of hasty judgements.<br />
<br />
Scholars have noted the strong similarity between a few of the stories in The 
Panchatantra and Aesop's Fables. Examples are 'The Ass in the Panther's Skin' 
and 'The Ass without Heart and Ears' "The Broken Pot" is similar to Aesop's "The 
Milkmaid and Her Pail", "The Gold-Giving Snake" is similar to Aesop's "The Man 
and the Serpent" and "Le Paysan et Dame serpent" by Marie de France (Fables) 
Other well-known stories include "The Tortoise and The Geese" and "The Tiger, 
the Brahmin and the Jackal".<br /><br /> Similar animal fables are found in most cultures of
the world, although some folklorists view India as the prime source. India is 
described as the "chief source of the world's fable literature" in Funk and 
Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore Mythology and Legend.<br />
<br />
The French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine acknowledged his indebtedness to the 
work in the introduction to his Second Fables:<br />
<br />
"This is a second book of fables that I present to the public... I have to 
acknowledge that the greatest part is inspired from Pilpay, an Indian Sage".<br />
The Panchatantra is the origin also of several stories in Arabian Nights, 
Sindbad, and of many Western nursery rhymes and ballads.<br />
<br />
<strong>Origins and function:</strong><br />
<br /><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
In the Indian tradition, The Panchatantra is a nītiśāstra. Nīti can be roughly 
translated as "the wise conduct of life" and a śāstra is a technical or 
scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and 
human conduct. <br /><br />Its literary sources are "the expert tradition of political
science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling". It draws from the 
Dharma and Artha śāstras, quoting them extensively. <br /><br />It is also explained that
nīti "represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to 
win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men" and that nīti is "the 
harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, 
prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to 
produce joy".<br />
<br />
The Panchatantra shares many stories in common with the Buddhist Jataka tales, 
purportedly told by the historical Buddha before his death around 400 BCE. As 
the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, "It is clear that the Buddhists did not 
invent the stories. <br /><br />It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the
Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the Jātakas or the Mahābhārata, or 
whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, 
of ancient India."<br /><br /> Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral
folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no 
conclusive evidence.In the early 20th century, W. Norman Brown found that many 
folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice 
versa.<br />
<br />
An early Western scholar who studied The Panchatantra was Dr. Johannes Hertel, 
who thought the book had a Machiavellian character. Similarly, Edgerton noted 
that "The so-called 'morals' of the stories have no bearing on morality; they 
are unmoral, and often immoral.<br /><br /> They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in
the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government."Other scholars 
dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching dharma, 
or proper moral conduct.<br />
<br />
On the surface, the Pañcatantra presents stories and sayings which favor the 
outwitting of roguery, and practical intelligence rather than virtue.<br /><br /> However,
From this viewpoint the tales of the Pañcatantra are eminently ethical. the 
prevailing mood promotes an earthy, moral, rational, and unsentimental ability 
to learn from repeated experience<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed, the current scholarly debate regarding the intent and purpose of the 
'Pañcatantra'.whether it supports unscrupulous Machiavellian politics or
demands ethical conduct from those holding high office — underscores the rich 
ambiguity of the text.<br />
<br />
In the first frame story, the evil Damanaka ('Victor') wins, and not his good 
brother Karataka. The persistent theme of evil-triumphant in Kalila and Dimna 
Part One, frequently outraged readers among Jewish, Christian and Muslim 
religious leaders who encountered the work in translation.<br /><br /> Some scholars believe
that Ibn al-Muqaffa inserted a chapter at the end of Part One, which puts Dimna 
in jail, on trial and eventually to death, in an effort to assuage religious 
opponents of the work.<br />
<br />
The pre-Islamic original, The Panchatantra, contains no such dogmatic 
moralising. As Joseph Jacobs observed in 1888, ". if one thinks of it, the
very raison d'être of the Fable is to imply its moral without mentioning it."<br />
<br />
The work has gone through many different versions and translations from the 
sixth century to the present day.<br /><br /> The original Indian version was first
translated into a foreign language by Borzūya in 570CE, then into Arabic in 750. <br /><br />
This Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, 
Greek, Persian, Hebrew and Spanish, and thus became the source of versions in 
European languages, until the English translation by Charles Wilkins of the 
Sanskrit Hitopadesha in 1787.<br />
<br /><strong>
Early cross-cultural migrations:</strong><br />
<br />
The Panchatantra approximated its current literary form within the 4th–6th 
centuries CE, though originally written around 200 BCE. No Sanskrit texts before 
1000 CE have survived. According to Indian tradition, it was written by Pandit 
Vishnu Sharman, a sage. <br /><br />Buddhist monks on pilgrimage took the influential
Sanskrit text (probably both in oral and literary formats) north to Tibet and 
China and east to South East Asia. <br /><br />These led to versions in all Southeast Asian
countries, including Tibetan, Chinese, Mongolian, Javanese and Lao derivatives.<br />
<br />
<strong>How Borzuy brought the work from India:</strong><br />
<br />

The foolish carpenter of Sarandib, hiding under the bed on which lie his wife 
and her lover. She notices his foot and contrives a story to prove her 
innocence. Persian illustration of the Kalileh and Dimneh, 1333.<br />
<br />
The Panchatantra also migrated westwards, during the Sassanid reign of Khosru I 
Anushiravan. <br /><br />Around 570 CE his notable physician Borzuy translated the work from
Sanskrit into the Middle Persian language, and transliterated the main 
characters as Karirak ud Damanak.<br />
<br />
According to the story told in the Shāh Nāma (The Book of the Kings, Persia's 
late 10th century national epic by Ferdowsi), Borzuy sought his king's 
permission to make a trip to Hindustan in search of a mountain herb he had read 
about that is "mingled into a compound and, when sprinkled over a corpse, it is 
immediately restored to life." He did not find the herb, but was told by a wise 
sage of a different interpretation. The herb is the scientist; science is the mountain,
everlastingly out of reach of the multitude.<br /><br /> The corpse is the man without
knowledge, for the uninstructed man is everywhere lifeless. Through knowledge 
man becomes revivified."<br />
<br />
The sage pointed to the book Kalila, and Borzuy obtained the king's permission 
to read and translate the book, with the help of some Pandits.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Arabic classic by Ibn al-Muqaffa:</strong><br />
<br /><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 22.4px; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Borzuy's 570 CE Pahlavi translation (Kalile va Demne, now lost) was translated 
into Syriac.<br /><br /> Nearly two centuries later, it was translated into Arabic by Ibn
al-Muqaffa around 750 CE under the Arabic title, Kalīla wa Dimna. After the Arab 
invasion of Persia (Iran), Ibn al-Muqaffa's version (two languages removed from 
the pre-Islamic Sanskrit original) emerged as the pivotal surviving text that 
enriched world literature. <br /><br />Ibn al-Muqqaffa's work is considered a model of the
finest Arabic prose style, and "is considered the first masterpiece of Arabic 
literary prose."<br />
<br />
Some scholars believe that Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the second section, 
illustrating the Sanskrit principle of Mitra Laabha (Gaining Friends), became 
the unifying basis for the Brethren of Purity (Ikwhan al-Safa) — the anonymous 
9th century CE encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, Encyclopedia of 
the Brethren of Sincerity, codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge. <br /><br />A
suggestion made by Goldziher, and later written on by Philip K. Hitti in his 
History of the Arabs, proposes that "The appellation is presumably taken from 
the story of the ringdove in Kalilah wa-Dimnah in which it is related that a 
group of animals by acting as faithful friends (ikhwan al-safa) to one another 
escaped the snares of the hunter."<br /><br /> This story is mentioned as an exemplum when
the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one risaala (treatise), a crucial part of 
their system of ethics.<br />
