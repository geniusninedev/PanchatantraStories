<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
In the city of Vardhaman, there lived a wealthy merchant named Dantila. He held 
a great reception for his wedding attended by the king, the queen, their 
ministers and all the rich and influential persons in the city. Present at the 
reception was Gorambha, a lowly sweeper in the royal household. When Dantila saw 
him occupying a seat reserved for the nobles of the king, he ordered his 
servants to throw him out of his house.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Thus insulted, Gorambha thought to himself, “I am a poor man and so cannot give 
a fitting reply to such a wealthy person as Dantila. I must some how see that 
the king stops his favours to him.” Then he hit upon a plan to take revenge on 
Dantila.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
One early morning when the king was still in sleep, Gorambha pretending to sweep 
the king's bedroom began loudly murmuring, “Oh, how arrogant is Dantila! He has 
the cheek to lock the queen in his embrace.” Hearing this, the king demanded to 
know whether what Gorambh was murmuring is true. Did Dantila embrace the queen?</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“Oh, your majesty, I don't remember nor do I know what I was saying because I 
was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling,” the sweeper told the 
king.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Not satisfied with his reply the king thought that it was possible that the 
sweeper had seen Dantila, who had equal access to the royal household as 
Gorambha, embracing the queen. He remembered wise men saying that men were 
likely to talk in their sleep about what they did, saw and desired in the day. 
Women were chaste because men were not within reach or they were afraid of 
prying servants. Convinced that Dantila had indeed embraced the queen, the king 
barred Dantila from entering the royal household.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The merchant began grieving his fate though he had not done any harm to the king 
or his relatives even in his dreams. One day as Dantila was trying to enter the 
king's palace he was barred by the king's men. Seeing this Gorambha told them, 
“You fools, you are barring the great Dantila who has won the king's favours. He 
is powerful. If you stop him, you will meet with the same fate as I did at the 
hands of Dantila one day.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The merchant thought that it would do him good to make Gorambha happy and win 
his confidence. One evening he invited the sweeper for tea and presented him 
with expensive clothes and told him, “Friend, I had never meant to insult you. 
You had occupied a seat I had set apart for the learned. Kindly pardon me.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Pleased, the sweeper promised to win the king's favour for Dantila again. The 
next day, Gorambha repeated the same drama of pretending to talk irrelevantly, 
raving that the king was eating cucumber in the rest room. “What nonsense are 
you talking? Did you ever see me doing such things?” the king demanded to know. 
“No, your majesty. I do not know nor do I remember what I was saying because I 
was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling,” the sweeper said.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The king then realized that if what the sweeper had said about him was not true 
what he had said about Dantila also could not be true. A person like Dantila 
could not have done what Gorambha had told him. The king also found that without 
Dantila the affairs of the state had suffered and civic administration had come 
to a standstill. The king immediately summoned the merchant to his palace and 
restored to him all the authority he had enjoyed before he fell out of king's 
favour.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Damanaka resumed, “That is why we must know that pride goes before fall.” 
Sanjeevaka agreed. Taking him to the lion king, Damanaka introduced Sanjeevaka 
to Pingalaka. After exchanging pleasantries, the king asked him to relate his 
past and the purpose of staying in that jungle. On the bullock relating his 
story, the king said, “Friend, don't be afraid. I assure you that I will protect 
you from wild animals here because even stronger animals feel insecure here.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Since then, the king asked Karataka and Damanaka to look after the affairs of 
the state and began happily spending his time in the company of Sanjeevaka. But 
the jackals were worried that after Sanjeevaka had become a good friend of the 
king, the king gave up his royal sports and pastime and became a saint.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The jackal twins thought, “the king has stopped taking us into confidence after 
Sanjeevaka became his best friend. He is also indifferent to his kingly duties. 
What shall we do now?”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
Karataka said, “The king may not heed our advice. But it is our duty to advise 
him on it if it is good for him. Elders have always held that even if the king 
is not willing to heed good advice, it is the duty of his ministers to offer him 
advice. “You are right,” said Damanaka. “The mistake is mine. What happened to 
the sage and the jackal should not happen to us.”</p>
