sparrows made their home on a branch of a big tree and lived happily
there.Soon it was winter and it began to rain heavily. Frequent gusts of wind 
made the cold unbearable. At this time, a monkey completely drenched in the rain 
and shivering from cold, came scurrying to the tree for cover.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Seeing the condition of the monkey, the female sparrow said, “Gentleman, with 
your feet and hands you seem to be a human being. Why didn't you build a house 
for yourself?' Angered by this uncalled for advice, the monkey said, “you 
stupid, why do not you shut up and mind your business?' The monkey told himself, 
“My, what impudence! This bit of a creature has the cheek to offer me advice. 
Makes fun of me. Unnecessary prattle. I must teach her a lesson. Why shouldn't I 
kill her?”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Turning to the female, the monkey said, “How does it help you to worry about my 
plight? Haven't you heard this saying of the elders that you should offer advice 
to those who seek it and cherish it? Advice to him who is indifferent is like a 
cry in the wilderness. Don't try to do that.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
When the female persisted, the monkey climbed up the tree and broke up the nest 
of the sparrow pair.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
“That's why,” said Karataka to Damanaka, “you should be careful in offering 
advice. You are a fool who does not understand the essence of my advice. That is 
not your mistake. Fools ignore advice and wise men follow it and benefit by it. 
It is clear that you haven't heard the story of Dharmabuddhi and his son 
Papabuddhi, the story of how the father was killed by smoke due to the son's 
thoughtlessness.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“Why don't you tell me that story,” asked Damanaka.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
In a city in the north, lived two friends named Dharmabuddhi and Papabuddhi. One 
day, Papa thought, “I am a man without worldly wisdom and added to that I am 
also poor. Let me persuade Dharma to take me to far off lands and earn lots of 
money through his business skills. Later I will deprive him of all his wealth 
and live happily ever after.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
With these plans on his mind, Papa told Dharma, “My friend, you are growing old 
and cannot manage your business. Unless you go out into the wide world how can 
you tell your children about the wonders of the world? Elders have said that he 
is born in vain who does not see the countries in the world, learn several 
languages and know the dress styles of other people. You cannot earn wealth and 
knowledge without wide travel.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Dharma liked this advice and taking the blessings of his teachers set out on 
overseas travel, taking Papa with him. Both of them earned a lot of money abroad 
due to the business talent of Dharma. It was time for them to return home 
because it is natural for people who go abroad in search of wealth and learning 
to think of home when they have achieved both.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
As they were entering their native place, Papa told Dharma, “It is not safe to 
take home all this wealth because relatives and friends in need will seek help 
if they know about our riches. We shall bury most of our money in some secret 
place in this forest. Whenever we need money, we can come here and take whatever 
we need. You know that money tempts even saints.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
Dharma agreed to Papa's plan and went home after both of them dug a pit and 
covered it after burying most of their earnings in it. One midnight Papa went to 
the secret place in the forest and stole all the money and brought it home. Next 
morning, he went to Dharma and suggested that they should go to the forest 
because he was in need of money.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
When both of them arrived at the secret spot in the forest and dug there, they 
found the pit empty. At once Papa began shouting loudly, “Dharma, you stole the 
money and nobody else. The pit was carefully covered. You must give me half of 
what we have buried here.' Though Dharma denied it, Papa insisted that they 
should take the dispute to a court of law.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
When the case came before the court, the judge asked them to take oath in the 
name of God. But Papa quoted experts as saying that relevant documents should be 
produced first as proof, then witnesses would be summoned to give evidence and 
oath in the name of God is taken when neither documents nor witnesses are 
available.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
"I can produce the gods of the forest as witnesses. They will determine who is 
guilty and who is innocent,” said Papa. Impressed by this plan, the judges asked 
both the parties to be present next morning at the forest for a hearing. Happy 
at the judges' order, Papa went home and told his father, “Father, I have stolen 
all Dharma's money. There is a case in the court that I can win only with your 
help. Otherwise, my life will be in danger.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“What have I to do to get that money, son,” asked his father.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“There is a big tree there. You have to go now and hide in the hollow of that 
tree. Tomorrow morning when the judges and others assemble there, I will ask you 
to tell the truth. Then it is your turn to declare that Dharma is the thief,” 
said the son.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The father left at once for the forest to hide in the hollow of the tree. The 
morning of the next day, the son took a bath and went to the tree taking Dharma 
and the judges with him. Papa went near the tree and shouted, “O sun, moon, air, 
fire, earth, water, the God of Death, day and night, you are all witnesses to 
the history of humanity. O Goddess of the Forest, declare who among us is 
guilty.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The father shouted back from inside the hollow of the tree, “Listen all of you, 
it is Dharma who stole the money.” The judges and the king's men heard the 
verdict and sat down to decide what punishment they should give Dharma. 
Meanwhile, Dharma filled the hollow with rags and hay, poured oil on them and 
threw a matchstick into it. The fire forced the half-burnt father to come out of 
the tree.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“All this is the work of Papa's evil mind,” said the father and soon collapsed 
and died. The king's men at once bound Papa hand and foot and hung him to a 
tree. They said, “Our elders have always said that wise men should not only be 
resourceful but also know the consequences of being resourceful. </p>
