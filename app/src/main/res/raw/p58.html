Once upon a time, there was a king who kept a monkey as a pet. The monkey served 
the king in whatever way he could. He had a free run of the royal household 
because he was the king’s pet. One hot day the monkey sat fanning by the side of 
the king who was sleeping. He noticed a fly on the chest of the king and tried 
to swish it away. The fly would go away for the moment and come back again to 
sit on the king's chest.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The monkey could take it no longer and decided to teach the fly a lesson. He 
looked for a dagger to kill it and when he found it brought it down with all 
force on the fly. The fly flew away but the king died as result of the dagger 
blow delivered by the monkey.</p>

Karataka said, “Therefore, the lesson is that a king who cares for his life 
should not have a fool as his servant.’ He went on to relate a second story to 
show how shrewd people save the lives of others.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Once upon a time a Brahmin lived in a big city and as a result of his misdeeds 
in his previous birth he became a thief. He saw four other Brahmins from another 
city selling a variety of goods in his city. He thought he should somehow 
deprive the four Brahmins of their money and through sweet words become their 
good friend. He was useful to them in whatever way he could. True, it comes 
naturally for women of vice to act coy and for charlatans to pretend to be 
learned.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The four visitors sold all their goods and with the money from the sales bought 
pearls and precious jewels. The Brahmin thief was keeping an eye on what they 
were doing even as he pretended to serve them faithfully. One day, in the 
presence of the Brahmin, the traders cut open their thighs and storing the 
jewels and pearls inside the thighs sewed them back.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The Brahmin was disappointed that they did not give him even a small part of 
their wealth. He immediately decided to follow them and kill them in the middle 
of their journey back home and take all that wealth from them.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
He told the traders with tears in his eyes, “Friends, you seem to be ready to 
leave me behind. My heart is broken because it is difficult for me to snap the 
bonds of friendship with you. If you will be so kind as to take me with you, I 
will be very grateful to you.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Moved by his request, the traders started their homeward journey accompanied by 
the Brahmin thief. They passed through several villages, towns and cities before 
they reached a village inhabited by thugs. Suddenly, they heard a group of crows 
loudly shouting, “You thugs, very rich people are coming. Come, kill them and 
become rich.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
The thugs at once attacked the Brahmin traders with sticks and began examining 
their bags. But they found nothing. They were surprised because this was the 
first time that the words of the crows turned out to be false. They told the 
traders, “O traders, the crows always tell the truth. You have the money with 
you somewhere. Take it out or we will cut every limb of yours and bring it out.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
The Brahmin thief pondered, “These thugs will certainly pierce the body of the 
traders to grab the jewels. My turn also will come. It is better I offer myself 
to these thugs and save the lives of the Brahmins. There is no point in fearing 
death because it will come today or after hundred years. One cannot escape it.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
With these thoughts on his mind, the Brahmin thief asked the thugs to first kill 
him and see if there was anything valuable on his body. The thugs accepted the 
offer and found nothing on him after they pierced his body. They let go the 
other four Brahmins thinking that they also did not have anything precious on 
their bodies.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
As Karataka and Damanaka were discussing the ways of the world, Sanjeevaka 
engaged Pingalaka in a short battle in which Pingalaka clawed him to death. But 
the lion was immediately struck by remorse and, recalling the good days he had 
spent with the bullock, began repenting:</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“O I have committed a great sin by killing my friend. There cannot be a greater 
sin than killing a trusted friend. They who forget a favour or breach a trust or 
let down a friend will all go to hell as long as the sun and the moon shine in 
the sky. A king will perish whether what he loses is his kingdom or a faithful 
servant. A servant and a kingdom are not the same because you can always win 
back the kingdom but not a trusted servant. In the court, I have always praised 
Pingalaka. How can I explain his death to the courtiers?”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Damanaka approached the grief-stricken king and told him, “O lord, ruing the 
death of a grass eater is cowardice. It is not good for a king like you. The 
learned have always said that it is not a sin to kill a person for treason even 
if that person is a father, brother, son, wife or a friend. Similarly, one must 
abandon a tender-hearted king, a Brahmin who eats all kinds of food, an immodest 
woman, a wicked assistant, a disobedient servant and an ungrateful person.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Damanaka continued, “You are mourning the death of someone who does not deserve 
sympathy. Though you are talking like a learned man, you forget that learned men 
do not think of the past or the dead.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
These words of Damanaka worked like a tonic providing relief to Pingalaka’s 
troubled mind. Pleased with this advice, the lion king reappointed Damanaka as 
his minister and continued to rule the forest.</p>
