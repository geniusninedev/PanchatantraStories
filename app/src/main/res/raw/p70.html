Shandili and Sesame Seeds:</h1>

“Brihat began telling the story. "I sought the hospitality of a Brahmin one day 
for sacred ceremonies connected with the monsoon season. He was kind enough to 
offer me space in his house and in return I used to render services he found 
useful in his rituals. As this arrangement continued, one fine morning I heard 
the Brahmin and his wife Shandili discussing what they should do for the day. 
The husband told his wife, “Today is the time when the Sun begins his northward 
journey and a time when the rich and pious people offer gifts to Brahmins. I am 
going to the next village to receive the offerings. You will do well to invite a 
Brahmin as guest today and offer him food in the name of the Sun.”</p>

“The wife flew into a rage and told him, “How can I offer anything to anyone in 
your poverty-stricken house? Aren’t you ashamed to make such a suggestion? I 
have wasted my entire life as your wife. I haven’t tasted a good meal so far 
even on a single day. Nor do I have any jewellery.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“Though taken aback, the Brahmin quickly recovered and said, “Such words are not 
becoming of you. The learned say that if you share even half of your meal with a 
mendicant, you will get whatever you wish in life. What good the rich reap by 
liberally giving away, the poor get by parting with even a cent they have. The 
giver deserves to be served even if he is poor. But a rich miser is shunned. It 
is like the well and the sea. People drink the water from the well and not the 
sea. We must always give to him who deserves. Greed can only destroy a person.”</p>

“How is it?” asked the wife.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“The husband then told Shandili the story of the hunter and the greedy jackal.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
A hunter went to the forest in search of a kill. Spotting a well-fed boar he 
took his bow and aimed a sharp arrow at the boar. Though severely wounded, the 
boar made a wild charge at the hunter goring him to death. The boar too died 
later from the wounds inflicted by the hunter.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
“Meanwhile, a hungry jackal, not knowing that he was doomed to die, came on the 
scene where the bodies of the hunter and the boar lay. He was thrilled by the 
sight of so much food and thought, “God has favoured me today. That’s why he has 
sent so much food for me. It is not without reason that the learned have said 
that he who has done a good deed in a previous birth is rewarded in this birth 
even if he does not make any effort. This great feast is certainly the result of 
some good I have done in a previous birth. But a man must enjoy his wealth in 
small doses. Therefore, I will begin my meal with this gut of the bow.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
The jackal went close to the body of the hunter and began nibbling at the gut of 
the bow. The gut suddenly snapped with great force killing the jackal in the 
end. “That’s why,” the Brahmin told his wife, “Haven’t you heard that a man’s 
longevity, destiny, wealth, learning and death are predetermined by God even as 
the child is in the womb of the mother.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“If that is the case,” Shandili said, “I have some un husked sesame seeds in the 
house. I will make a cake from it and serve it to a Brahmin.” Happy at his 
wife’s words, the Brahmin left for the next village. The wife soaked the seeds 
in warm water, removed their husk and left them on a cloth to dry in the sun. As 
the Brahmin’s wife was busy with other chores, a dog came and peed on the seeds 
left on the cloth to dry.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
“When the wife saw what the dog had done, she felt miserable that all her effort 
had gone in vain. She thought that nobody could undo God’s will. She thought, 
“These seeds cannot now be given away to anyone. I will see if I can exchange 
them for un husked seeds. Anybody will agree to this swap.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“Brihat continued his story, “The Brahmin’s wife came to the same house which I 
was visiting to accept offerings. She offered to exchange the husked seeds to 
anyone ready to accept them. Then the woman in the house came out and was ready 
to accept the husked seeds from the Brahmin’s wife. But her son intervened and 
told her, “Mother, these seeds are not good. Why should anyone give away good 
husked seeds for the raw seeds? There must be some reason for it.” The housewife 
at once gave up the idea of taking husked seeds from the Brahmin’s wife.”</p>

“After Brihat completed the story, he asked Tamrachud, “Do you know the route he 
(Hiranyaka) takes to come here?”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“I have no idea,” said Tamrachud.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“Have you any tool to dig?” asked the visitor.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“Yes, I have a dibble with me.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“In that case, let us follow the mouse trail before it is erased,” said the 
visitor.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Hiranyaka resumed his account and said, “Listening to the conversation between 
Tamrachud and Brihat, I thought that my end had come. Just as he had found my 
food store, he is capable of tracking my fort. Learned men can measure the 
strength of the rival by just looking at him. I decided immediately to take a 
new route and was on my way with the other mice when a fat cat sighted us. He 
immediately pounced on us and killed a number of my retinue.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“Excepting me, those of the bloodied mice who escaped being killed by the cat 
took the same old route to the fort. The visitor saw the trail of blood the 
fleeing mice left behind and following it reached my fort. There, Brihat and 
Tamrachud dug and found the food store. The visitor told Tamrachud, “Here is the 
secret of the mouse’s energy. Now, you can sleep in peace.” Then they took the 
store to the temple, the home of Tamrachud.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“I went back to where I had stored food. It was now like a desert. Without food, 
the spot was a ghastly scene. I did not know where to go and what to do to get 
back my peace of mind. Somehow, I spent the day in sorrow and when it was dawn 
went to the temple followed by what remained of my retinue. Alerted by the noise 
we made, Tamrachud again began striking the food bowl with the bamboo. Brihat, 
the visitor, asked him why he was doing so. Tamrachud told him about our 
return.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“The visitor laughed and told Tamrachud, “Friend, don’t be afraid now. The mouse 
has lost his energy. It cannot do any mischief now.” When I heard this, I was 
angry and tried again to jump at the food bowl and crashed to the ground before 
I could reach the bowl.”</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
“I was dejected by this failure. But my sadness increased when I heard my 
retinue telling each other that I was no more capable of earning food for them 
and they should immediately give up serving me. I then realised the importance 
of riches and decided to somehow steal it back from Tamrachud. When I made 
another attempt, the visitor saw me and banged the bamboo on my head. I somehow 
managed to escape.”</p>

“Elders have always said that man gets what he is destined to. Even God cannot 
alter destiny. So, I stopped brooding over what has happened because<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;What
