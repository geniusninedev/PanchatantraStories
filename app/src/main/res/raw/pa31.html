The Price of Indiscretion:</h1>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
In the city of Nagara, there was a carpenter whose name was Ujjwalaka and who 
was extremely poor. One day he was pained to realize that every one else in his 
profession was rich and happy and that he alone was very poor. He thought Nagara 
was not the proper place for him to prosper and that he must go out and seek his 
fortune elsewhere. Then he left that city and began his journey to a new 
country. When the sun was fading, he reached a cave in a forest.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
There he saw a female camel that separated from her caravan and just then 
delivered a child. The carpenter gave up his plans to go to another country and 
went home taking the camel and her calf with him. Every day he would go into the 
forest and bring back with him bundles of tender leaves for the camel and her 
child to eat. The she camel regained and her strength and the calf now became an 
adult. The carpenter began selling camel milk and making good money.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
Ujjwalaka loved the camel so much that he bought a bell and hung it to her neck. 
One day he thought to himself, “If one camel can bring so much money for me, how 
much more would I earn if I buy more camels and sell their milk?” He told his 
wife that he would borrow some money to go to Gujarat and buy a she camel and 
that she should take care of the she camel and her calf till he returned from 
Gujarat.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
He went to Gujarat and returned home with a she camel. Slowly, the number of 
camels he had increased several times. He appointed a keeper to take care of the 
camel herd he had on the condition that he would give one camel to the keeper 
every year as remuneration. The keeper was also free to drink camel milk twice a 
day. Now, everything was fine for the carpenter and he and his wife thus lived 
happily ever after.</p>

The camels used to go every day to a nearby forest to feed on the fresh green 
leaves available in plenty in the forest. After spending a lot of time in the 
forest, eating and playing, the camels trekked back home. But the senior she 
camel stayed on in the forest and joined the herd later. The other camels 
thought that the she camel was a fool to go her separate ways and what would she 
do if a wild animal attacked her.</p>

One day a lion saw all the camels leaving the forest in a herd and the she camel 
staying back and loafing about. By the time she finished her leisurely grazing, 
the others left and reached home. The she camel lost her way and was in panic 
when the lion, which was following her, pounced on her and soon tore her to 
pieces.</p>

“That’s why I tell you that he who does not follow the advice of wise men 
perishes like the camel,” said the monkey.</p>
<p style="margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">

The croc replied, “You are right, if you follow advice given for your good you 
will face no danger either here or in the heaven above. Yet, what is great about 
doing good to a person who is good? He who helps a person who has done him harm 
is considered great by learned people. That’s why take pity on me and give me 
advice.”</p>

The monkey said, “In that case, you go and fight that big croc who has occupied 
your home. If you die in that battle, you will go to heaven. If you win the 
battle, you will get back your house. Know this from me:</p>
